        <h1 align="center">OUR PHILOSOPHY</h1>
        <hr width="75%" size="3" noshade="#000">
        <p align="center">Our philosophy is holistic and profound, as it encompasses all aspects of life 
            that transforms an individual into a well rounded personality. We ardently 
            believe in developing both mind and body such that our children grow up into 
            healthy, thoughtful and winning adults. We have devised a framework for success 
            that consists of SIX Pillars.</p>
        <hr width="25%" size="3" noshade="#000">
        <h3><center>TOTAL ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE AND HIGH IQ</center></h3>
        <p align="center">“SUCCESS is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to 
            Excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.” FIITJEE Global School 
            is committed to achieving superlative Academic Excellence. We are adopting the 
            best curriculum, curating the best teachers and delivering value through 
            innovative means. We have taken special care to handpick faculty who share the 
            same rigor and discipline that we possess. Our innovative teaching methodology 
            makes us deliver a very high value to the learning process and whet the 
            inquisitive appetite of our students. Right from children’s initiation into 
            schooling we focus on a differentiated learning paradigm whereby the child’s 
            interest is kindled in diverse subjects. This curiosity and eagerness are 
            sustained in subsequent years by introducing deeper concepts, thereafter 
            leading to the development of historical perspectives, mathematical ability and
            logical thinking. A balanced world-view is what we instill over the course of 
            the students’ school journey. In synchronization with our flagship company, 
            FIITJEE’s legacy of superlative success in tough competitive examinations like 
            IIT-JEE, NEET and other entrance tests, FIITJEE Global School has natural 
            affinity to unparalleled excellence in “Competitive Academics”. Our efforts in 
            Academia would eventually manifest itself in stupendous results in Boards and 
            Competitive Exams.</p>
        <hr width="25%" size="3" noshade="#000">
        <h3><center>DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION SKILLS</center></h3>
        <p align="center">“Communication is the human connection that is the key to personal 
            and career success”. “Good Communication skills not only build bridges but also 
            take one to the pinnacle of success.” We at FIITJEE Global School give immense 
            focus to the all-round development of communication capabilities. On one hand we 
            develop the requisite expertise in Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing and 
            on the other; we encourage the students to delve into public speaking, recitation,
            debating and group discussions. Our commitment to communication is such that we 
            guarantee dexterity in at least two more languages apart from the ever important 
            English language. We promote our students to opt for a second international language 
            that would make them globally competitive. Our Department of English has been 
            entrusted with the additional responsibility to hone the all round communication 
            abilities and personality of students.</p>
        <hr width="25%" size="3" noshade="#000">
        <h3><center>SPORTS FOR PHYSICAL FITNESS AS A DISCIPLINE IN LIFE</center></h3>
        <p align="center">“Sport is such a great teacher. It teaches camaraderie, humility, 
            how to resolve differences”. “Sports creates character, builds character, and 
            reveals character” is a truism and embodies the FIITJEE Global School approach 
            to sports as a mechanism to not only keep fit but to also teach us self-discipline 
            and lead to character building. We believe that sports spurs physical fitness as a 
            discipline in life; hence we promote a myriad range of competitive anrnationally 
            popular sports both within and outside the campus. We encourage students to take up 
            at least one sport as a mandatory discipline. We envisage our children to partake in 
            advanced & professional level sports championships and showcase their mettle. Our proposed 
            association with prestigious sports bodies and institutions like MRF Academy, Pace Foundation,
            Mahesh Bhupathi Academy of Tennis etc. encourages our students to experience the very 
            best in class facilities and develop their innate sporting talents like never before.</p>
        <hr width="25%" size="3" noshade="#000">
        <h3><center>LIVE THE CULTURE TO INCULCATE RIGHT VALUE SYSTEM AND HIGH EQ</center></h3>
        <p align="center">“Culture is the curry that enhances the taste of life.” “A nation's culture 
            resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people”. The famous words of Mahatma Gandhi 
            inspire us. We try hard to instil the wisdom of our great Indian culture in our students. 
            We are pledged to inculcate a high standard value system amongst the children that we nurture. 
            We pride in our Indianness and bask in the glory of the ancient wisdom of our country’s 
            diversity. Culture is built through active engagement in plays, workshops, skits, lectures, 
            excursions and heritage expeditions etc. For a full understanding, kindly visit our Culture section; 
            it would give further insight into our world of culture.</p>
        <hr width="25%" size="3" noshade="#000">
        <h3><center>YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR PHYSICAL, MENTAL FITNESS AND DEVELOPING HIGH SQ</center></h3>
        <p align="center">“Yoga is not the option to a good life, it is the basis of a 
            great life.” “When the breath wanders the mind also is unsteady, but when the breath 
            is calmed the mind too will be still, and the yogi achieves long life. Therefore, 
            one should learn to control the breath.” –Courtesy Hatha Yoga Pradipika. We practice 
            and preach the tenets of Yoga and Pranayama in our schools as we believe that they 
            increase physical, mental and spiritual fitness. The yogic kriyas and asanas are taught 
            by maestros and certified professionals. We want our children to be psycho-physically 
            fit such that they are forever sharp in their mind and body. Due care is taken to ensure 
            age-appropriate yoga routines and special attention is given to safe practices that are 
            child-friendly.</p>
        <hr width="25%" size="3" noshade="#000">
        <h3><center>DEVELOPING WINNING ATTITUDE ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS</center></h3>
        <p align="center">“The Altitude that you want to climb to is defined by your Attitude and 
            Capacity for Hard work”. “Your attitude decides your altitude” is our credo and hence 
            we take pains to nurture the right attitude in our children. Without the development 
            of the right attitude, one can find it difficult to succeed in life. In order to achieve 
            the balanced combination of a positive mental attitude and a personable personality, we 
            calibrate the minds of the students. This is done through a minute observation by a panel 
            of behavioural experts who try to unleash and develop the hidden talents of the students. 
            Special emphasis is given to the flowering of amiable personality traits that lead to 
            success. Our mantra is simple- “Foster the right attitude & let the personality blossom 
            then success becomes the only outcome.”</p>
