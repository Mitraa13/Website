        <h1><center>CURRICULUM & METHODOLOGY</center></h1>
        <p>The school aims at nurturing individuals with sound moral values and multivalent 
            competencies. This task is accomplished by virtue of a dynamic curriculum that 
            encompasses not only academic excellence but aesthetic refinements, effective 
            skills and the art of living. We impart education that is contemporary, based on 
            skills and at the same time meets global standards. Our core thinking is ‘modernity 
            blending with tradition’.<br><br>

            The School will be affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Initially, 
            the school will offer admission in grades LKG to VIII and will then move up one further grade 
            each year. The curriculum as defined by CBSE will be followed in letter and spirit, however 
            we have done a complete transformation of learning by providing exhaustive materials based on 
            thorough research and curating world-class and indigenous content. The approach to the development 
            of the curriculum has been scientific and delves deeper than what is available anywhere 
            else in the country.<br><br>
            
            Our methodology encourages scientific temper, improvement in oral & written communication, 
            love for visual and performing arts excellence in physical education, development of cultural 
            values, as well as mindfulness. Project and research-based learning has been weaved into with an 
            emphasis on concept clarity and application of knowledge.The hallmark of our teaching-learning process 
            is triggering of questions and seeking answers. The right use of technology has been incorporatedfor a 
            seamless digital delivery and augmented real and virtual classroom experience.<br><br>
            
            At FGS, extra-curricular activities receive equal importance. Through sports, arts and cultural 
            programmes, the school helps to shape children into better, more rounded personalities. Through 
            an emphasis on extra-curricular programmes, the school creates the ideal ground for unleashing 
            imagination, learning team spirit and an understanding & appreciation of the world's timeless heritage cum 
            diversity. Here disciplines are tied together in complementary ways and teachers help children fulfill their 
            natural curiosity to learn.<br><br>
            
            The curriculum of Fiitjee Global School follows the guidelines of the Central Board of Secondary 
            Education. It stresses on developing higher order thinking skills (HOTS) against rote learning.
            Our classroom teaching goes beyond textbooks and focus on real-life experience. Activity-based teaching is 
            supported with tablets and projection facilities. Highly qualified and trained faculty impart teaching in a

    <h2 align="center">KIDUS OPTIMUS - FOUNDATION</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the world of FIITJEE Global Schools’ KIDUS OPTIMUS, a truly transformative 
        place where the youngest children get to learn, explore and develop their innate skills. 
        The nomenclature of our Early childhood education brand KIDUS OPTIMUS has a deeper meaning, 
        beneath the veneer of the obvious references to Kids and Optimism.</p>

    <p>The connotation of KIDUS is the "Blessed one" or “One that is Pure”. Its origins can be 
        traced back to the "Ethiopian Culture". It deeply signifies the divine purity of the 
        innocent souls of children. OPTIMUS comes from Latin, which means "The Best." It also 
        denotes maximization & optimization of potential i.e. complete transformation and metamorphosis 
        of the self.</p>
        
    <p>At KIDUS OPTIMUS, the youngest children can embrace their natural curiosity and identify 
        their drive to learn. KIDUS OPTIMUS nurtures young children in the finest and most immaculate 
        ways that have never been implemented in India. Our unique methodologies make children mentally, 
        physically, emotionally & spiritually more powerful, ambitious and confident. Young children are 
        easily able to comprehend theory, create meaning, and to understand a complex and multifaceted 
        world. At FIITJEE Global School’s Early childhood/Kindergarten section, we scaffold joyful exploration 
        to take kids’ learning even deeper. Through rich open-ended experience and reflection, our young kids 
        develop into resourceful, curious and resilient adults. We look forward to sharing our unique and enchanted 
        creation with you.</p>

    <h2 align="center">PRIMARY YEARS (Grade III - V)</h2>
    <p>We facilitate a relaxed transition from the colourful world of early childhood to an equally 
        picturesque & metamorphic world of primary learning.Education is a life - long journey and the 
        School realizes the importance of a good start. It is primary school level that sets the foundation 
        for the love of learning and through the years it is strengthened.<br><br>

        At this stage, the School expects the students to embed the basics and explore the world. They 
        learn to question, analyze, classify and communicate their perceptions. An unconventional system of 
        teaching is adopted by the School where education is imparted through a blend of books, and play-way 
        methods. Concepts are taught via videos, origami, clay modelling, sand play and painting. A suitably 
        designed child- centered curriculum based on phonetics, provides the children with a strong foundation of 
        spelling and vocabulary. The entire course establishes and strengthens vital skills like motor and 
        reading skills, language and communication skills, writing and number concepts.<br><br>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Teachers further enrich the curriculum through music, art, library and computer programmes.</li>
        <li>The students also learn about the significance of festivals and are encouraged to imbibe Indian values in their lives.</li>
        <li>Hobbies like Art and Craft, Theatre Work, Indian Music, Pottery Work, Dance, Green Club become a part of the day’s routine and run parallel to the academic curriculum.</li>
        </ul>
        In Primary years, we build a strong foundation in Mathematics,,with an emphasis on Mental Mathematics, in our children. 
        We encourage lessarning of new concepts through activities using Math games equipment, puzzles and worksheets. 
        We focus on creating real life situations.<br><br>
        
        Ongoing Assessment is a very important aspect for both the learner and the teacher. The work 
        done in all the subjects (academic and non-academic) is reviewed frequently and discussed with 
        students and parents.<br><br>
        
        Children are natural scientists, and at FGS they are encouraged to explore and observe, use 
        their logic, analyze and then come to conclusion. We provide our young learners with ample 
        opportunities to apply what they have learnt in the form of Project displays and Experiments 
        conducted.<br><br>
        
        To be a caring citizen of this world, it is important to understand our culturally diverse 
        country first. At FGS we encourage our children to first explore their immediate environment and 
        then their city, state, country and the world.<br><br>
        
        We believe that the parents need to get involved with their children’s learning process from the primary 
        grade days itself.We provide an opportunity for the same in the form of meaningful Homework. Homework is 
        set for approximately 25 minutes to 45 minutes of work based on application of learning that has been done 
        in the class. Parents are expected to go through and sign all the work sent home for their perusal. Through 
        interesting Homework,we also encourage self-study for the student.<br><br>
        
        The primary sections’ sports curriculum is graded for each class and based on skill development. There is a 
        Games period allocated on all days and children are expected to play and participate in all events.Athletic Meet, 
        Inter House Cricket, Basketball, Badminton and Volleyball matches are a part of our yearly primary calendar.
        Coaching is imparted to the students of Classes II, III in Tennis by certified coaches from renowned Lawn Tennis 
        professionals.<br><br>
        
        During the primary years, gymnastics is part of the curriculum.<br><br>
        
        Picnics and excursions form another very popular agenda of our yearly plan, where, children are taken out of school 
        for the day on a planned activity. This not only helps in bonding amongst different groups of students, but also 
        strengthens the teacher – student bond. Occasional movies shown in school, the Annual School Fete, are some of the 
        other activities our children enjoy through the year.</p>

    <h2 align="center">MIDDLE YEARS (Grade VI-VIII)</h2>
    <p>

        students to make them adept in any field from Languages, Mathematics, Science and 
        Technology or Performing Arts. We take care of the increasing range of opportunities 
        and the astounding variety of careers opening up due to the remarkable developments. 
        The third language we offer takes into consideration new economic trends and changing 
        geo-political phenomena.<br><br>

        Every moment is an opportunity to learn and classrooms turn into laboratories and playgrounds 
        with the added element of fun. While basic principles and theories are taught in the classroom, 
        a lot of experimentative learning takes place. Students are made to learn from experience and 
        analysis. Scientific temperament is honed, and our practices ensure that students never hesitate 
        to question a statement or clarify a doubt.A great deal of emphasis is placed on 
        'one-on-one' teaching and we organize interaction with people eminent in diverse fields.
